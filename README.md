# zooproj

This was one of my final projects for my mobile apps dev class for the Fall semester 2020.  It involved creating arrays of different animals (in this case Dogs and Cats) and using multiple view controllers in xCode. An animal class was used so I could make animal objects out of it.  Users can select one animal from the list of animals in the first view controller, then the program navigates them to the second view controller which will show more detailed info on that animal.  Info such as their name, where they live, what they eat, etc. are displayed in the second view controller.  There are also thumbnail images of the animals featured in the first view controller to give the user an idea of what the animal looks like.
